# AI Planner Demo (Logseq-inspired)

This is a **UX-only** prototype:

- Journals (daily notes)
- [[Links]] + #tags + backlinks
- Cmd+Enter cycles block status: TODO → DOING → DONE
- Query filters (status/tag/contains/scope) + save as dashboard views
- Uses **localStorage** only (no backend, no AI calls)

## Run locally
Open `index.html`.

## Deploy
Intended for GitHub Pages.
